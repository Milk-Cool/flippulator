# flippulator
An emulator for the Flipper Zero\
Based on [Flipper Zero Firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware)

## Requirements
A linux system\
Packages `make`, `gcc`, `libsdl2-dev:i386`, `gcc-12-multilib` (or an alternative that's compatible with your current gcc version), `libbsd-dev:i386`

## Usage
`npm start` will generate the `out_<app name>/<app name>` executable.

## Limitations
- The main function cannot be called `main`
- `furi.h` must be included
- Right now, only the `InputTypePress` and `InputTypeRelease` input types are supported
- A variable cannot be named `time`
- Integer types like `long unsigned int` do not have the same size as they do on the flipper. **If you care about integer sizes, use `intXX_t` and `uintXX_t`!**

## Known issues
- Defining a string as `char* str = "abc"` and then setting its value using snprintf gives you a segfault
- Storage calls might interact with the outer filesystem
- It builds an x64 app, which is not good since the Flipper Zero apps are 32-bit

## What's supported so far:
- Canvas and viewports (no icons)
- Input
- Some core functions
- Records
- Vibration
- FuriStrings
- FuriThreads
- FuriSemaphores
- FuriMutexes
- FuriPubSubs
- FuriEventFlags
- FuriApiLocks
- Timers
- Crashing
- CLI (although very limited)
- Storage

## TODOs
- [x] Use ~~GTK~~ SDL instead of ncurses
- [ ] Write support for FuriTypes (FuriString, FuriMutex, etc.)
- [ ] Add settings to the notification service
- [ ] Storage CLI
- [ ] Remove code duplicating in storage_ext.c and storage_int.c


### Uhm, akstually, it is not an emulator ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è...
Yes, it is not. It just compiles flipper applications for your computer.
