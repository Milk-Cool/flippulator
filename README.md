# flippulator
An emulator for the Flipper Zero\
Based on [Flipper Zero Firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware)

## Requirements
A linux system\
Packages `make`, `gcc`, `libncurses5`

## Usage
`npm start` will generate the `out` executable.

## Limitations
- The main function cannot be called `main`
- `furi.h` must be included
- `furi.h` includes `ncurses.h`, which reserves some function names such as `clear` and `refresh`
- Due to ncurses limitations, only the `InputTypePress` input type is supported.

## TODOs
- [ ] Use GTK instead of ncurses
- [ ] Write support for FuriTypes (FuriString, FuriMutex, etc.)


### Uhm, akstually, it is not an emulator ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è...
Yes, it is not. It just compiles flipper applications for your computer.
